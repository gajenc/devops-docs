# Deploying Kubernetes

Deploying and managing Kubernetes on your own is hard, which is why managed Kubernetes services have emerged as a streamlined way to deploy containers in the public cloud. Managed Kubernetes is evolving, and serverless containers are slowly are becoming a norm.

When running Kubernetes at scale, managing, operating, and scaling its infrastructure to maximize cluster utilization — without suffering from idle resources — can be a big challenge. There are too many your development team needs to manage and configure. This includes selecting the best instance type and size, determining when to scale up or down, and making sure all of the containers are scheduled and running on the best instances — and that is even before starting to think about cost resource optimization.
